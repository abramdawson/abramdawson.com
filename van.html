            I started the process of converting a 2014 Ram Promaster 159" (3500 EcoDiesel engine) into a tiny home. I bought the van used with 45k miles on it.

            After scrubbing the interior, I installed Rattletrap and furring strips. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TUNRGM/" target="_blank">Rattletrap</a> is a sound deadener, it's the silver stuff plastered all over the walls &amp; ceiling. I had 50 square feet total, which I cut into a bunch of 6x18" strips for the walls, and 2x18" strips for the ceiling. The furring strips (horizontal pieces of wood) are intended to make the sides flush with the frame of the van. This will make installing walls easier.

            I installed the first half of the subfloor. The subfloor is comprised of 3 parts: 1/4" plywood strips, 1/2" polyiso insulation, 1/2" plywood boards (in that order, from bottom to top).

            The 1/4" plywood strips are intended to make the floor flat, so that the insulation doesn't bend/compress as people walk on it. As you can see, the metal floor is not a flat surface.

            I took a bunch of measurements to determine the interior layout for the driver's side wall. A queen bed will extend to the left of the image, drivers seat to the right. There will be a table in front of the bench seat.

          <p class="mono">
            I also outlined what the wiring will look like. Diamonds denote fuses; heavy borders are energy sources. I used the app <a href="https://monodraw.helftone.com/" target="_blank">Monodraw</a> to do this (I love this product, I use it for wireframing apps as well). I'm not sure if this is right, but it's what I came up with after watching a bunch of YouTube videos. I will run this by an electrician or someone more knowledgeable about this stuff prior to installation.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            I also placed a big Amazon order. I bought everything in the wiring diagram, aside from the wires.

            I taped and then cut a 14x14" hole in the roof and installed a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002OWAIB8/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=d754fdf0-fd52-4edd-8917-8e65a84c20d5&pd_rd_wg=b3198&pf_rd_r=GZ4T4ZX64JB71EJH9N27&pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-top-slot&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=B002OWAIB8&pd_rd_w=dPuUR&pf_rd_i=maxxair+fan&pd_rd_r=96a4dda9-8d34-43c1-a062-cdb24d7b5ff5&ie=UTF8&qid=1533405994&sr=1" target="blank">Maxxair Fan</a>. It has a rain cover, which is nice since I can keep the fan open even when it's raining. My dad was helping me that day, and we also installed a <a href="http://www.discountvantruck.com/Promasterswivelbases/promasterseatadaptersswivels.htm" target="blank">seat swivel base</a> for the driver's seat. It fits well, so I ordered a second swivel for the passenger seat as well.

            After installing all the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NUYBW0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">14 AWG</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPG1ZC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">12/2</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP7X8G/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">10/3</a> wiring (for 12V appliances, 110V appliances, and shore power, respectively), I started on the insulation. I sprayed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stuff-Gaps-Cracks-Cleaner/dp/B06XHQ26GY/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1533407172&sr=8-5&keywords=great+stuff+pro" target="blank">Great Stuff Pro</a> into the rails/support beams of the van. Then I cut up a bunch of <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Common-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-Actual-0-9375-in-x-3-875-ft-x-7-875-ft-Expanded-Polystyrene-Foam-Board-Insulation/3365576" target="blank">1" polyiso rigid foam insulation</a> and started installing it on the ceiling.

          <p class="mono">
            The wooden boards are 1/2" OSB cut into a bunch of 2" pieces. I used them to hold the insulation in place while I sprayed Great Stuff along the edges. Great Stuff will expand as it cures, and it holds the insulation in place really well.

            I installed 2" polyiso insulation on the walls. Installing insulation isn't much fun â€“ it takes a while and is a pain to work with.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            There are a handful of areas I needed to insulate that are too large for Great Stuff, but too small/non-geometric for foam boards (large vertical beams, roof corners). So I diced some of the extra polyiso foam and installed it in those areas.
