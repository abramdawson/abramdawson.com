            There are a handful of areas I needed to insulate that are too large for Great Stuff, but too small/non-geometric for foam boards (large vertical beams, roof corners). So I diced some of the extra polyiso foam and installed it in those areas.

            My brother was getting married in August and I was going to be traveling for 5 days, so I brought the van to the dealership since the check engine light came on saying I needed to repair one of the glow plugs. The dealership had been a nightmare to deal with since day 1, so the only reason I brought the van back to them was because it was still under their warranty and all repair costs would be covered by them. While repairing the glow plug, they managed to break one of the cylinders. It took them *4 weeks* to fix their mistake. From mid August to mid September I wasn't able to work on the van, so this step was a practice in patience.

            Upon return of the van and prior to working on the plywood sheathing for the walls, I ended up removing the rear floor in order to install <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSVU3WF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">T-nuts</a>, which will be used to mount the L-track system in place. I should have done this when I originally installed the floor, but at that time I wasn't planning to use L-track.

          <img class="ui fluid separated image" src="./i/van/floor_treenuts.jpg">
          <p class="mono">
            T-nuts allow you to attach bolts to an area where you don't have access to the back. In this case, I won't be able to hold a nut in place while I tighten the bolt holding the L-track in place, which is why I used T-nuts. They're often used on climbing walls, since you're unable to access the rear of the wall while installing/changing the holds. The L-track will be anchored into the T-nuts using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X2V74MG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">1/4x1" stainless socket screws</a>.

They're mounted less than 1" off of the roof, so when looking at the van from street level, you can't exactly tell they're solar panels.

As mentioned in Step 8, I had previously installed bolts attached to the vehicle frame that would anchor my bed frame. So I installed the bed post, which is made of 1x4" clear pine, and then began to construct the frame that the mattress will rest upon.

            The bottom of the bed frame sits 39.5" above the floor, which should be enough space to store a few mountain bikes.

            And then I added 62" slats that run perpindicular, which will help with weight distribution. This is what my mattress will sit on.

            I built the "living room", which consists of one unit that houses both the refridgerator and sofa (see Step 4). On top of the fridge (black box in the top left) will sit a 22x22" countertop, and below it will be a drawer/storage. The sofa/bench is on the right, it's 42" long so it should fit 2 people. The frame is built out of 1" by various sized (either 3 or 4") clear pine boards. Again, I used pocket holes &amp; wood glue to secure everything.
          </p>
          <img class="ui fluid separated image" src="./i/van/living_room_install.jpg">
          <p class="mono">
            Here you can see where the unit will be installed (after some sanding/priming/painting). I also started working on a 6" step (wood piece to the right of the unit) that will be used when the driver/passenger seats are swiveled around. Under the step will be storage. The driver &amp; passenger seats are 24" off the floor (normal height is around 18"), so without the step your feet dangle in the air, hence why I built the step.

            Each battery weights 140lbs, so ensuring they're properly secured (and weight is evenly distributed) is important since I don't want them flying towards me if I were to break suddenly. I used steel hanger iron and stainless steel bolts to make straps, and wrapped 2 around each battery. I attached the straps to the L-track using stainless D-rings and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CREBAQE/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">double lug L-track fittings</a>.
