            My brother was getting married in August and I was going to be traveling for 5 days, so I brought the van to the dealership since the check engine light came on saying I needed to repair one of the glow plugs. The dealership had been a nightmare to deal with since day 1, so the only reason I brought the van back to them was because it was still under their warranty and all repair costs would be covered by them. While repairing the glow plug, they managed to break one of the cylinders. It took them *4 weeks* to fix their mistake. From mid August to mid September I wasn't able to work on the van, so this step was a practice in patience.

          <p class="mono">
            Prior to working on the plywood sheathing for the walls, I ended up removing the rear floor in order to install <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSVU3WF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">T-nuts</a>, which will be used to mount the L-track system in place. I should have done this when I originally installed the floor, but at that time I wasn't planning to use L-track.

          <img class="ui fluid separated image" src="./i/van/floor_treenuts.jpg">
          <p class="mono">
            T-nuts allow you to attach bolts to an area where you don't have access to the back. In this case, I won't be able to hold a nut in place while I tighten the bolt holding the L-track in place, which is why I used T-nuts. They're often used on climbing walls, since you're unable to access the rear of the wall while installing/changing the holds. The L-track will be anchored into the T-nuts using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X2V74MG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">1/4x1" stainless socket screws</a>.

The panels fit well on the roof and sit just behind the roof fan. They're mounted less than 1" off of the roof, so when looking at the van from street level, you can't exactly tell they're solar panels.

I then used 5/16" carriage bolts to attach the entire frame to the van's factory installed roof rack tie downs (the bolts pointed up in the picture).

            The bottom of the bed frame sits 39.5" above the floor, which should be enough space to store a few mountain bikes.

            And then I added 62" slats that run perpindicular, which will help with weight distribution. This is what my mattress will sit on.

            I built the "living room", which consists of one unit that houses both the refridgerator and sofa (see Step 4). On top of the fridge (black box in the top left) will sit a 22x22" countertop, and below it will be a drawer/storage. The sofa/bench is on the right, it's 42" long so it should fit 2 people. The frame is built out of 1" by various sized (either 3 or 4") clear pine boards. Again, I used pocket holes &amp; wood glue to secure everything.

          <p class="mono">
            Here you can see where the unit will be installed (after some sanding/priming/painting). I also started working on a 6" step (wood piece to the right of the unit) that will be used when the driver/passenger seats are swiveled around. Under the step will be storage. The driver &amp; passenger seats are 24" off the floor (normal height is around 18"), so without the step your feet dangle in the air, hence why I built the step.

          <p class="mono">
            I also anchored the batteries to the van. Each battery weights ~120lbs, so ensuring they're properly secured is important since I don't want one of those flying towards me if I were to break suddenly. I wrapped steel hanger iron in 2 places around around each battery and then used 2 stainless bolts per piece to secure the strap in place. I attached the strap to the L-track using some stainless D-rings and some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CREBAQE/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">double lug fittings</a>.

            I wanted a waterproof layer between the floor people will see/walk on and the plywood sub floor, so I found a piece of vinyl in the remnants section at Lowes for $20 and installed that. Since nobody will see this, I didn't care what it looked like which is good becuase it's hideous.

            The step has 3 pieces that lift up to reveal storage space, so to keep them in place while driving I countersunk some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071ZKQ2X5/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">neodymium magnets</a> to the bottom of those pieces. I really like magnets and plan to use them quite frequently in this build.

            Here is what the step and living room unit look like after being primed. I also installed those same magnets on the underside of the bench seat.
